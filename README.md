Final work in first year of middle school

First version was deleted by hackers from my cloud drive and backup on flash drive was not able to load properly, that just my luck, so this is my second version. I was working on it for 8 to 10 hours. Well since friday 10pm to 5am on saturday and then during weekend for another hour or two combined.
